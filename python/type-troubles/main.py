"""
Implement a python3 function that accepts one argument named “pet”, but acts differently based on the type of object
passed in. If the function is passed a Dog object, call the bark() method on the object. If the function is passed a
Cat object, call the meow() method on the object. If neither a Dog or Cat is passed, raise an exception.
